            <p class="card-text">We all know the story. The Pilgrims were floating about looking for some new digs when they ran out of beer. So, they pulled the Mayflower over, landed in the U.S. and began searching for stuff they could brew with. They stumbled over some pumpkins, gave thanks and voila! The Pumpkin beer craze was born. The beer became so popular that brewers started making it available to the natives around August. Well, maybe you heard a slightly different version of the story but for craft beer lovers Pumpkin beers are the first sign of the coming Fall season. And like Christmas in July, if you buy it in August they will brew it...</p>

                As Mythbusters' ballistics expert, Alex Jones, has said, "Remember kids, the only difference between screwing around and science is writing it down."

                During the brew day, one of the most important things to write down and one of the very last things to write down is Original Gravity. Original Gravity dictates whether the desired ABV will be achieved in a brew. It dictates whether the hop additions will provide the desired balance. It determines whether or not the brew day went as planned. Ultimately, it's a measure of how well the brewer knows their brewery...

                Mitch Ermatinger spent a late July evening completely redefining his production calendar.

                As the owner of Speciation Artisan Ales in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he has the luxury of making the drastic changes late into the year. Ermatinger also has the comfort of being at the helm of the two-employee operation, which will finish the year making approximately 150 barrels of beer.

                “It’s totally haphazard,” Ermatinger said. “My whole schedule for the rest of the year changed because I sat down in front of a computer and was in the mood to make a production schedule.
