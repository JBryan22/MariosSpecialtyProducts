                Mitch Ermatinger spent a late July evening completely redefining his production calendar.

                As the owner of Speciation Artisan Ales in Grand Rapids, Michigan, 
                he has the luxury of making the drastic changes late into the year.
                Ermatinger also has the comfort of being at the helm of the two-employee operation,
                which will finish the year making approximately 150 barrels of beer.
